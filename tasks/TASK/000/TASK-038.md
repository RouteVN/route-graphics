<img width="853" height="988" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-17 at 17 22 07" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8d46820-f530-4d62-beaf-93557ed71446" />


vt/specs/spritetransition/sprite-fade-in-layer.yaml

current: blue circle is on top of the red circle

expected: red circle should be on top of the blue circle


seems to happen only when we add animation to the blue circle
