# Description

- do a presentation for the team for current interface
- need to balance easy to use with presets, and very customizability
- check with AI, use it with [ultrathink](https://discord.com/channels/1388082134748500139/1388082136627548222/1422431597839388753) to come up with some alternative better interfaces
- think of some real VN with particle effects
- think how user will be able to edit those from UI
- list down the limitations, so we check those limitations are acceptable
- present and discuss this with team to get feedback
