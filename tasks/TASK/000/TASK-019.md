# Description


## Context

Currently, route-graphics supports mostly static assets, and some tween animations.
In Visual Novels there is usually effects like rain, snow etc... that create a more immersive atmosphere. We want route-graphics to support such functionality.

## Research

Research the following:

- How to impement rain and snow effects in PixiJS. Can we do this within PixJS or need something external?
- Understand the limitations and possibilities we have
- Anything we can learn from other Visual Novel engines, how do they implement it

## Requirements

- Although we want support rain and snow effects, we want to be able it to be very flexible and able to support all kinds of different effects and customizations
- We want to design a configuration/API that is easy enough to use for the user

## Plan

Fill in here the implementation plan after the research has been conducted
