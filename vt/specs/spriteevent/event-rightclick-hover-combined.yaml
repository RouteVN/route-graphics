title: Sprite Combined Hover and Right-Click Tests
description: Test right-click functionality combined with hover events on sprite elements; uses colored sprite assets intentionally to validate src/texture transitions (guideline exception for asset-based tests).
specs:
  - "sprite should handle right-click and hover events independently"
  - "sprite should show hover cursor and still support right-click"
  - "sprite should change src on hover and right-click differently"
  - "sprite should send correct actionPayload for each event type"
  - "sprite should support all three: hover, right-click, and click"
