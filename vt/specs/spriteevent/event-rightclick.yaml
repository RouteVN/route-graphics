title: Sprite Right-Click with Hover and Click
description: Test right-click functionality combined with hover and click events on sprite elements
specs:
  - "sprite should handle right-click and click events independently"
  - "sprite should show hover cursor and still support right-click"
  - "sprite should change texture on hover, click, and right-click differently"
  - "sprite should play different sounds for different click types"
  - "sprite should send correct actionPayload for each event type"
