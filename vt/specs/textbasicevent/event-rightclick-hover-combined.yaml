title: Text Combined Hover and Right-Click Tests
description: Test right-click functionality combined with hover events on text elements
specs:
  - "text should handle right-click and hover events independently"
  - "text should show hover cursor and still support right-click"
  - "text should change style on hover and right-click differently"
  - "text should send correct actionPayload for each event type"
  - "text should support all three: hover, right-click, and click"
