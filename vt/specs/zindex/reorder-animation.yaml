title: Z-Index Reorder During Animation
description: Tests that z-order updates correctly when elements are reordered in AST during animated transitions; uses colored sprite assets intentionally to track layer swaps (guideline exception for asset-based tests).
specs:
  - "z-order should update immediately when AST order changes"
  - "blue circle should move from back to front during reorder"
  - "red circle should move from front to back during reorder"
steps:
