# Burst / Explosion Effect Example
#
# Creates a one-shot radial explosion of particles.
# All particles spawn at once, shoot outward in all directions, then fade out.
# Perfect for hit effects, impact animations, or celebration bursts.
#
# Customization tips:
# - Change spawnShape.data.x and y to position the burst center
#   (x: 640, y: 360 would center burst in 1280x720 scene)
# - Adjust particlesPerWave and maxParticles for bigger/smaller burst (30-100 recommended)
# - Modify speedStatic range for faster/slower explosion
# - Change spawnShape.data.radius for tighter/looser spawn point
# - Adjust lifetime for longer/shorter burst effect
