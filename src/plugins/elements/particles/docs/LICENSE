This directory contains code adapted from @pixi/particle-emitter
(https://github.com/pixijs-userland/particle-emitter)

The original library was created by CloudKid and is maintained by the PixiJS community.
This adaptation has been simplified for the route-graphics plugin architecture.
The Sprite-based approach from the original library works unchanged in PixiJS v8.
